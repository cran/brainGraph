\title{Calculate an asymmetry index based on edge counts}
\usage{
edge_asymmetry(g, level = c("hemi", "vertex"), use.parallel = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{The igraph graph object}

\item{level}{A character string indicating whether to calculate asymmetry for
each region, or the hemisphere as a whole (default: 'hemi')}

\item{use.parallel}{Logical indicating whether or not to use \emph{foreach}
(default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A data table with edge counts for both hemispheres and the asymmetry
index; if \emph{level} is 'vertex', the data table will have \emph{vcount(g)}
rows.
}
\description{
This function will calculate an asymmetry index that is a measure of whether
or not more edges are present in the left or right hemisphere of a graph for
brain MRI data. You can choose a value for each vertex, or for the whole
hemisphere.
}
\details{
The equation is:
\deqn{A = \frac{E_{lh} - E_{rh}}{0.5 \times (E_{lh} + E_{rh})}}
where \emph{lh} and \emph{rh} are left and right hemispheres, respectively.
The range of this measure is \eqn{[-2, 2]} (although the limits will only be
reached if all edges are in one hemisphere), with negative numbers
indicating more edges in the right hemisphere, and a value of 0 indicating
equal number of edges in each hemisphere.
