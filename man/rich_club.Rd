\description{
\code{rich_club_coeff} calculates the \emph{rich club} of a graph, returning
the rich-club coefficient, \eqn{\phi}, and the subgraph of rich club
vertices.

\code{rich_club_all} is a wrapper for \code{\link{rich_club_coeff}} that
calculates the rich-club coefficient for all degrees present in the graph. It
returns a \code{data.table} with the coefficients and vertex and edge counts
for each successive rich club.

\code{rich_club_norm} will (optionally) generate a number of random graphs,
calculate their rich club coefficients (\eqn{\phi}), and return
\eqn{\phi_{norm}} of the graph of interest, which is the observed rich-club
coefficient divided by the mean across the random graphs.

\code{rich_core} finds the boundary of the rich core of a graph, based on the
decreasing order of vertex degree. It also calculates the degree that
corresponds to that rank, and the core size relative to the total number of
vertices in the graph.
}
\details{
If random graphs have already been generated, you can supply a list as an
argument.

For weighted graphs, the degree is substituted by a normalized weight:
\deqn{ceiling(A / w_{min})}
where \eqn{w_{min}} is the minimum weight (that is greater than 0), and
\eqn{ceiling()} is the \emph{ceiling} function that rounds up to the nearest
integer.
