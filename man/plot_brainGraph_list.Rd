\title{Write PNG files for a list of graphs}
\usage{
plot_brainGraph_list(g.list, fname.base, diffs = FALSE, cols = c("none",
  "lobe", "comm"))
}
\arguments{
\item{g.list}{A list of \code{igraph} graph objects}

\item{fname.base}{A character string specifying the base of the filename for
\emph{png} output}

\item{diffs}{A logical, indicating whether or not to highlight edge
differences (default: FALSE)}

\item{cols}{A character string indicating how to color the vertices (default:
'none')}
}
\description{
This function takes a list of \code{igraph} graph objects and plots them over
an axial slice of the brain. A \emph{png} file is written for each element of
the list, which can be joined as a \emph{gif} or converted to video.
}
\details{
You can choose to highlight edge differences between subsequent list
elements, and whether to color vertices by \emph{lobe}, \emph{community}
membership, or \emph{lightblue} (the default). By default, the vertex sizes
are equal to vertex degree, and max out at 20.

This function may be particularly useful if the graph list contains graphs of
a single subject group at incremental densities, or if the graph list
contains graphs of each subject in a group.
